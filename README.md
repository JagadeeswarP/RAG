The app supports multiple input types, including:

- **Link (URL)**
- **PDF**
- **Text**
- **DOCX**
- **TXT**

## Features

- Upload documents or provide links to process and store information.
- Text embeddings are generated using **Google Gemini** for better context understanding.
- Ask questions based on the uploaded content and receive answers using the Gemini model.

## Setup

Follow these steps to get the app running locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
